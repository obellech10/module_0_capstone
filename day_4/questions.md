## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
It allows you to define chunks of code that can easily be reused throughout your program. Minimizes you having to repeat the same code multiple times.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
def hello(Sam)
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
hello_someone(Sam)

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
Are there such things as global methods that can be used across different code files?
