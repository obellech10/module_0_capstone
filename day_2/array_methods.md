##Array methods in Ruby

.last - Returns the last element(s) in an array. Does not mutate the array.
.sort - Returns a new array with the elements arranged in alphabetical order if string, and ascending value order if numbers
.each - Passes each element in the array once as a parameter. This allows us to do something to each element.  
.join - Returns a string by converting each element of the array into a string and then combining them. If a separator is given then the method inserts it between each element of the array.
.index - Returns the index number of the methods given argument. Only returns the index of the first object that matches the argument.
.include? - Checks to see if the argument given is included in the array. Returns true if given argument is included. It has a question mark at the end of it, which usually means that it will return a boolean value.
.collect - Method creates a new array containing the values returned by the block. This is done by passing each element of the existing array as an argument through the block.
.first - Returns the first element(s) in an array. Does not mutate the array.
.shuffle - Returns a new array with the elements of the existing array in random order.
